I started mapping and creating the card to append. 

I fetched all the arrays and put them together in one array. My idea was using this "mamaList" as an initial content(allcards). 

From there, using Spread sintax, I was planing to destructure this mamaList based on clicks.

I got stuck around 16hrs of sunday 25/5, got in panic and start making buttons to append the results... 

The current website shows the individual results of each filter.
